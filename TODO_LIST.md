# To Do list :)

## To do at some point before handing in the project:
[ ] Check that the instructions for generating the Pytorch data is clear and works

## Alice
[x] Run PI experiment with tanh activation
[ ] Run PI experiment with ReLU activation
[ ] Change architecture to multiple switching last layers
[ ] Run PI experiment with switching last layers

## Mandana
[x] Run PI experiment on watermaze
[ ] Plot the grid code patterns for the trained model on watermaze 
[ ] Rescale the environment and train the LSTM using previously generated ensemble to check if they are transferable
[ ] Collaborate with Arna to get the plots on the navigation tasks

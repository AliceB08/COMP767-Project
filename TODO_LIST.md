# To Do list :)

## To do at some point before handing in the project:
[ ] Check that the instructions for generating the Pytorch data is clear and works

## Alice
[x] Run PI experiment with tanh activation
[x] Run PI experiment with ReLU activation (1 activation)
[x] Change architecture to multiple switching last layers
[x] Run PI experiment with switching last layers (oupsi, no change in seed)
[x] Rerun the switching thing with 3 targets (doing, should be finished tomorrow lunchtime)
[ ] Plot the SAC with news switching targets
[x] check that the loss is going down with the switching targets
[x] Retrain with freezing the weights of the LSTM
[x] rerun the exp with second activation ReLU
[ ] plot the SAC for the exp with second activation ReLU
[ ] Give to Mandana the name of the experiment to use for LSTM PI module (to do today)

## Mandana
[x] Run PI experiment on watermaze.
[x] Give to Arna the model trained on watermaze.
[ ] Plot the grid code patterns for the trained model on watermaze.
[ ] Rescale the environment and train the LSTM using previously generated ensemble to check if they are transferable.
[ ] Collaborate with Arna to get the plots on the navigation tasks.

## General
[ ] Clean github
[ ] Add TAs and Doina to github

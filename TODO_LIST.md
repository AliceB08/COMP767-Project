# To Do list :)

## To do at some point before handing in the project:
[ ] Check that the instructions for generating the Pytorch data is clear and works

## Alice
[x] Run PI experiment with tanh activation
[x] Run PI experiment with ReLU activation (1 activation)
[x] Change architecture to multiple switching last layers
[x] Run PI experiment with switching last layers (oupsi, no change in seed)
[ ] Rerun the switching thing with 3 targets (doing, should be finished tomorrow lunchtime)
[ ] Plot the SAC with news switching targets
[ ] check that the loss is going down with the switching targets
[ ] Retrain with freezing the weights of the LSTM
[ ] rerun the exp with second activation ReLU (to do today)
[ ] plot the SAC for the exp with second activation ReLU
[ ] Give to Mandana the name of the experiment to use for LSTM PI module (to do today)
